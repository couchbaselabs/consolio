<h1>Couchbase Cloud FAQ</h1>


<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>Q: What is Couchbase Cloud?</dt>
    <dd>Couchbase Cloud is a free Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway instance that helps Couchbase Lite developers up and
        running quickly.
    </dd>
    <dt>Q: How does it work?</dt>
    <dd>It’s free! Couchbase Lite, our embedded JSON database for mobile was designed with sync capability in mind.
        Couchbase Lite works with Couchbase Sync Gateway, a sync tier that serves as an extension of our award-winning
        NoSQL database, Couchbase Server.

        <br/><br/>
        On Couchbase Cloud, developers can start a Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server instance. Couchbase Lite-backed
        mobile apps that need to share, collaborate or securely back up data to a back-end store can use the Sync
        Gateway REST APIs to pull and push data to Couchbase Server.
        <br/><br/>
        Play around with Couchbase Cloud to see what a full Couchbase service stack can do for you.

<h3>II. Getting Started</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Q: How do I sign-up?</dt>
    <dd>It’s easy. Couchbase Cloud uses Mozilla Persona to create and authenticate accounts. Sign-in with just a valid
        e-mail address, and a password. That’s it! Start your registration here to get your own Couchbase Cloud today.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q: How do I create and connect to Couchbase Cloud Sync Gateways?</dt>
    <dd>After you’ve opened your Couchbase Cloud account, head over to your Dashboard. Click the “New Sync Gateway”
        button to create a new Couchbase Cloud Sync Gateway. This opens a Sync Gateway configuration window.
        <br/><br/>
        Give your Sync Gateway a name, and add your custom Sync Function code. If you are unfamiliar with the Sync
        Function APIs, check out the documentation here. Below is an example and breakdown of some Sync Function code.

<pre>
{
    "interface":":4984",
    "adminInterface":":4985",
    "log":["REST"],
    "databases":{
    "sync_gateway":{
        "server":"http://localhost:8091",
        "bucket":"sync_gateway",
        "sync":`function(doc) {channel(doc.channels);}`
    }
}
</pre>

        The local database is called sync_gateway and is served from port 4984, with the admin interface on port 4985.
        <br/><br/>
        Click the “Create” button to submit the configuration. The Sync Gateway URL is displayed. Use that URL for Sync
        REST API requests.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3>III. Couchbase Cloud Account Management</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>Q: How do I change my Couchbase Cloud username or password?</dt>
    <dd>Our account authentication is handled by Mozilla Persona, with each account username tied to a valid e-mail
        address. While username updating is limited in Persona, you can easily update your password at
        login.persona.org.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q: Can I connect directly to my Couchbase Cloud Couchbase Server instances instead of through Sync Gateway?</dt>
    <dd>It’s an offering that we’re actively thinking about, but in the meantime if you’re looking for access to
        Couchbase Servers, we recommend checking out our Amazon Marketplace offerings, or download Couchbase Server for
        your in-house use.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q: Are there REST APIs for Sync Gateway?</dt>
    <dd>The sync is performed using REST calls from Couchbase Lite to Sync Gateway. For more information about the sync
        REST APIs, check out our Sync Gateway documentation here. We also have REST APIs for Sync Gateway
        administration.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q: Can I run commands to Couchbase Cloud through REST APIs?</dt>
    <dd>Yes! You can run commands to your Couchbase Cloud Sync Gateway, or any Sync Gateway, using our Admin REST APIs.
        First, find your Couchbase Cloud Sync Gateway’s Admin REST API port by going to your Dashboard, and clicking on
        your Sync Gateway instance’s “Admin” URL link. Using this URL, and the curl tool you can send REST API commands
        to your Sync Gateway.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3>IV. Security</h3>

        Couchbase Server, and Couchbase Sync Gateway. We recommend hosting your secure data on an in-house Couchbase
        Server instance, or on AWS via our Amazon Marketplace offerings.
